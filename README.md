# Week3  Day 3:

### Description:
  - A program that uses the RecyclerView and the Broadcasters to populate a page with items. The objects themselves are pojos with High amounts of Randomization. They are simply an Animal class where I create the interface for Animal 'stars' and it shows their fan base, age, type and talents. 
  - Within the application there are Toasts to recognize a few actions that are commonly done as well as some common status' of the phone.
  - It uses Broadcast Recievers as well as Recycler views and Intent services to perform several tasks.
